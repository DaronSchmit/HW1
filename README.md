# HW1 Code Refactoring

# Horiseon hmtl and css Refactoring

## Description 

In this project, I focused on making a functional webpage that had minimal redundant css elements as well as more descriptive containers for accessibility on the web.
While intimidating at first, being able to look at code and find where it can be better is a great way to become more familiar with the language you're working in. 

This project, ostensibly, is for a SEO company that is looking for a useful website to display their brand that is built with standard CSS and HTML semantics that lend 
themselves well to web accessibility.

## Installation

You can download this file and open index.html in your favorite browser in order to see the results. You can also feel free to use your favorite text editor to 
take a peek under the hood. 

Additionally, you can skip the downloading and go straight to https://daronschmit.github.io/HW1/ to see the webpage deployed live. You can then use the inspect tool to see the page's innards in-browser. 


## Usage 

This webpage is pretty straightforward. There are nav links on the top header bar for your convenience, otherwise it is mostly uninteractive


## Credits

credit to the University of Minnesota coding bootcamp for the starting files. The source is in a private gitlab, so I cannot share it. 
special thanks to Charlie, the instructor, as well as Jake, Paul, and the other TAs for answering so many questions
